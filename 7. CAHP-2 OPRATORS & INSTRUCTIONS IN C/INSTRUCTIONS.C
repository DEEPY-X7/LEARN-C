//THE declaration Instuction

int a;
float b;

//Other Variations
int i=10; int j=i; int a = 2; 
int ji= a + j - i;
float b = a+3; float a = 1.1;

int a,b,c,d;
int a=b=c=d=30;  //Valuc of a b. C &d will be 30 each

//arithmatic instructions
int i = (3 * 2) + 1;  // 3 and is a operands and +,* is a operators
//Operands Can be int/float etc.
//1+- */ are arithmatic operators
